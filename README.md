### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Bio

My name is Bruno Kenzo and I'm from Brazil. I've always liked technology and all the possibilities it opens to us.
I finally started exploring more about this universe and I hope I can contribute with many important projects soon.
Just started my studies in front-end development with HTML and CSS, but I intend to become a full stack developer in a near future.
